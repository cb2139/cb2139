# Hi there, I'm Charlie üòÅ

## My experience ü§ì
I'm a Masters-level biologist aspiring to build a career in computational genomics. Currently, I work in an Omics Technologies team at a large pharmaceutical company, where I aid the discovery of genomic targets and provide omics support across various disease areas. 
My experience involves extensive analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. I'm familiar with several common tools and pipelines, such as Cell Ranger, Seurat, tximport, and DEseq2. Most of my technical experience is with R and Linux, though I've also dabbled in Python.

## My projects üìö
Here are a few projects I have worked on: 
- [Haematopoeitic Stem Cells - Surface Marker Discovery](https://github.com/cb2139/mouse_blood_stem_cells.git): Analysed an index sorted single-cell surface transcriptome of murine haematopoeitic stem and progenitor cells, identifying a prospective surface marker for the identification of long-term haematopoeitic stem cells.   
- [Bladder Cancer - Hypoxia Analysis](https://github.com/cb2139/blca_hypoxia.git): Performed differential expression analysis between normoxic and hypoxic urothelial tissue, highlighting key transcriptomic drivers of the disease phenotype observed in hypoxic urothelial cancer tissue. 
- [The Cancer Genome Atlas - Bladder Cancer Variant Detection](https://github.com/cb2139/blca_nc-mutations.git): Used TCGA WGS data to determine the transcriptomic impact of non-coding mutations in muscle invasive bladder cancer. 
- [Atypical B-cells - Differentiation Timecourse Analysis](https://github.com/cb2139/abc_timecourse.git): Generated a differentiation landscape for atypical B-cells (ABCs), providing a resource to determine genetic drivers of ABC accumulation in inflammatory diseases. 

For my Masters project, I am planning to return to bladder cancer research with the [Mason Lab](https://asmasonomics.github.io/) where I will apply unsupervised machine learning to find clinically relevant and druggable subgroups of bladder cancer.
