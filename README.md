# Hi there, I'm Charlie üòÅ

## My experience
I'm a Masters-level biologist aspiring to build a career in computational genomics. Currently, I work in an Omics Technologies team at a large pharmaceutical company, where I aid the discovery of genomic targets and provide omics support across various disease areas. 
My experience involves extensive analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. I'm familiar with several common tools and pipelines, such as Cell Ranger, Seurat, tximport, and DEseq2. Most of my technical experience is with R and Linux, though I've also dabbled in Python.

## My projects
Here are a few projects I have worked on: 
- [Haematopoeitic Stem Cells: Surface Marker Discovery](Github link): Project description 
- [Bladder Cancer: Hypoxia Analysis](Github link): Project description
- [The Cancer Genome Atlas: Bladder Cancer Variant Detection](Github link): Project description
- [Atypical B-cells: Differentiation Timecourse Analysis](Github link): Project description
